Problem Statement:

An insurance company started a new insurance policy in the recent past. The company has launched a direct marketing campaign to expand its policy holder base. To this end the company sends one of its staff members to personally interact with potential customers likely to buy the insurance in an effort to convert her/him to a new policyholder.
The company wants to use predictive analytics to predict whether a person would buy its insurance product. If the prediction is “Yes” the person will be probed and if the prediction is “No” the person will not be probed. It may be assumed that the awareness level of the prospective customers about the product is such that no person would buy the product unless probed. Needless to mention, a person may or may not buy the product even after probing.

Assignment:

The dataset of 2000 records with labelled data and 500 records with target label missing and the Data dictionary that explains all 84 attributes in a record have been uploaded. Build a classification model that would maximize the profit on a test data set.

Submission format and Evaluation:

- A csv file containing the results (Policy bought or not) of the Test set in the same order (2001-2500)
- A one-page report in pdf format containing the final attributes of the dataset you retained for modeling, the modeling method you chose, and the parameters of the model (attributes retained for modeling etc) with brief arguments in favor of your decisions on such matters
- The report must contain the misclassification matrix of your final model when applied to Training set & Validation set respectively
- In case of any doubt or lack of clarity in the problem statement or data dictionary, make assumptions that you consider reasonable and go ahead
